                <span id="pgxi-p1-s0">THIS IS the fourth edition of the book “Alcoholics Anonymous.”
The first edition appeared in April 1939, and in the following
sixteen years, more than 300,000 copies went into circulation. </span>
                <span id="pgxi-p1-s1">The second edition, published in 1955, reached a total of more
than 1,150,500 copies. </span>
                <span id="pgxi-p1-s2">The third edition, which came off press in
1976, achieved a circulation of approximately 19,550,000 in all
formats. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxi-p2">
                <span id="pgxi-p2-s0">Because this book has become the basic text for our Society and
has helped such large numbers of alcoholic men and women to
recovery, there exists strong sentiment against any radical
changes being made in it. </span>
                <span id="pgxi-p2-s1">Therefore, the first portion of this
volume, describing the A.A. recovery program, has been left
largely untouched in the course of revisions made for the second,
third, and fourth editions. </span>
                <span id="pgxi-p2-s2">The section called “The Doctor’s
Opinion” has been kept intact, just as it was originally written in
1939 by the late Dr. </span>
                <span id="pgxi-p2-s3">William D. </span>

            <p id="pgxi-p3">
                <span id="pgxi-p3-s0">The second edition added the appendices, the Twelve Traditions,
and the directions for getting in touch with A.A. </span>
                <span id="pgxi-p3-s1">But the chief
change was in the section of personal stories, which was
expanded to reflect the Fellowship’s growth. “Bill’s Story,”
“Doctor Bob’s Nightmare,” and one other personal history from
the first edition were retained intact; three were edited and one
of these was retitled; new versions of two stories were written,
with new titles; thirty completely new stories were added; and
the story section was divided into three parts, under the same
headings that are used now. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxi-p4">
                <span id="pgxi-p4-s0">In the third edition, Part I (“Pioneers of A.A.”) was left
unchanged. </span>

follows. </span>
                <span id="pgxii-p1-s1">One new story has been added to Part I, and two that
originally appeared in Part III have been repositioned there; six
stories have been deleted. </span>

carried over, eleven new ones have been added, and eleven taken

                <span id="pgxii-p2-s0">All changes made over the years in the Big Book (A.A. members’
fond nickname for this volume) have had the same purpose: to
represent the current membership of Alcoholics Anonymous
more accurately, and thereby to reach more alcoholics. </span>
                <span id="pgxii-p2-s1">If you
have a drinking problem, we hope that you may pause in reading
one of the forty-two personal stories and think: “Yes, that
happened to me”; or, more important, “Yes, I’ve felt like that”; or,
most important, “Yes, I believe this program can work for me
too.” </span>

that brief space, Alcoholics Anonymous has mushroomed
into nearly 6,000 groups whose membership is far above
150,000 recovered alcoholics. </span>

America, Mexico, Alaska, Australia and Hawaii. </span>

of alcoholism. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p0-s5">Though he could not accept all the tenets of
the Oxford Groups, he was convinced of the need for moral
inventory, confession of personality defects, restitution to
those harmed, helpfulness to others, and the necessity of
belief in and dependence upon God. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxvi-p1">
                <span id="pgxvi-p1-s0">Prior to his journey to Akron, the broker had worked hard
with many alcoholics on the theory that only an alcoholic
could help an alcoholic, but he had suc-ceeded only in
keeping sober himself. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p1-s1">The broker had gone to Akron on a
business venture which had collapsed, leaving him greatly
in fear that he might start drinking again. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p1-s2">He suddenly
realized that in order to save himself he must carry his
message to another alcoholic. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p1-s3">That alcoholic turned out to
be the Akron physician. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxvi-p2">
                <span id="pgxvi-p2-s0">This physician had repeatedly tried spiritual means to
resolve his alcoholic dilemma but had failed. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p2-s1">But when the
broker gave him Dr. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p2-s2">Silkworth’s description of alcoholism
and its hopelessness, the physician began to pursue the
spiritual remedy for his malady with a willingness he had
never before been able to muster. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p2-s3">He sobered, never to
drink again up to the moment of his death in 1950. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p2-s4">This
seemed to prove that one alcoholic could affect another as
no nonalcoholic could. </span>
                <span id="pgxvi-p2-s5">It also indicated that strenuous
work, one alcoholic with another, was vital to permanent
recovery. </span>

alcoholics arriving in the ward of the Akron City Hospital. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p0-s1">Their very first case, a desperate one, recovered
immediately and became A.A. number three. </span>

another drink. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p0-s3">This work at Akron contin-ued through the
summer of 1935. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p0-s4">There were many failures, but there was
an occasional heartening success. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p0-s5">When the broker
returned to New York in the fall of 1935, the first A.A.
group had actually been formed, though no one realized it
at the time. </span>

            <p id="pgxvii-p1">
                <span id="pgxvii-p1-s0">A second small group promptly took shape at New York, to
be followed in 1937 with the start of a third at Cleveland. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p1-s1">Besides these, there were scattered alcoholics who had
picked up the basic ideas in Akron or New York who were
trying to form groups in other cities. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p1-s2">By late 1937, the
number of members having substantial sobriety time
behind them was sufficient to convince the membership
that a new light had entered the dark world of the
alcoholic. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxvii-p2">
                <span id="pgxvii-p2-s0">It was now time, the struggling groups thought, to place
their message and unique experience before the world. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p2-s1">This determination bore fruit in the spring of 1939 by the
publication of this volume. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p2-s2">The membership had then
reached about 100 men and women. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p2-s3">The fledgling society,
which had been nameless, now began to be called
Alcoholics Anonymous, from the title of its own book. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p2-s4">The
flying-blind period ended and A.A. entered a new phase of
its pioneering time. </span>

            <p id="pgxvii-p3">
                <span id="pgxvii-p3-s0">With the appearance of the new book a great deal began to
happen. </span>

                <span id="pgxvii-p3-s2">Harry Emerson Fosdick, the noted clergyman,
reviewed it with approval. </span>
                <span id="pgxvii-p3-s3">In the fall of 1939 Fulton
Oursler, then editor of Liberty, printed a piece in his
magazine, called “Alcoholics and God.” This brought a rush

out. </span>

referred to these prospective newcomers. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p0-s3">New groups
started up and it was found, to the astonishment of
everyone, that A.A.’s message could be transmitted in the
mail as well as by word of mouth. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p0-s4">By the end of 1939 it was
estimated that 800 alcoholics were on their way to
recovery. </span>

                <span id="pgxviii-p1-s1">Rockefeller, Jr. gave a
dinner for many of his friends to which he invited A.A.
members to tell their stories. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p1-s2">News of this got on the world
wires; inquiries poured in again and many people went to
the bookstores to get the book “Alcoholics Anonymous.’’ By
March 1941 the membership had shot up to 2,000. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p1-s3">Then
Jack Alexander wrote a feature article in the Saturday
Evening Post and placed such a compelling picture of A.A.
before the general public that alcoholics in need of help
really deluged us. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p1-s4">By the close of 1941, A.A. numbered
8,000 members. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p1-s5">The mushrooming process was in full
swing. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p1-s6">A.A. had become a national institution. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxviii-p2">
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s0">Our Society then entered a fearsome and exciting
adolescent period. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s1">The test that it faced was this: Could
these large numbers of erstwhile erratic alcoholics
successfully meet and work together? </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s2">Would there be
quarrels over membership, leadership, and money? </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s3">Would
there be strivings for power and prestige? </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s4">Would there be
schisms which would split A.A. apart? </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s5">Soon A.A. was beset
by these very problems on every side and in every group. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s6">But out of this frightening and at first disrupting
experience the conviction grew that A.A.’s had to hang
together or die separately. </span>
                <span id="pgxviii-p2-s7">We had to unify our Fellowship

                <span id="pgxix-p0-s0">As we discovered the principles by which the individual
alcoholic could live, so we had to evolve principles by
which the A.A. groups and A.A. as a whole could survive
and function effectively. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p0-s1">It was thought that no alcoholic
man or woman could be excluded from our Society; that
our leaders might serve but never govern; that each group
was to be autonomous and there was to be no professional
class of therapy. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p0-s2">There were to be no fees or dues; our
expenses were to be met by our own voluntary
contributions. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p0-s3">There was to be the least possible
organization, even in our service centers. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p0-s4">Our public
relations were to be based upon attraction rather than
promotion. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p0-s5">It was decided that all members ought to be
anonymous at the level of press, radio, TV and films. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p0-s6">And
in no circumstances should we give endorsements, make
alliances, or enter public controversies. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxix-p1">
                <span id="pgxix-p1-s0">This was the substance of A.A.’s Twelve Traditions, which
are stated in full on page 561 of this book. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p1-s1">Though none of
these principles had the force of rules or laws, they had
become so widely accepted by 1950 that they were
confirmed by our first International Conference held at
Cleveland. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p1-s2">Today the remarkable unity of A.A. is one of the
greatest assets that our Society has. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxix-p2">
                <span id="pgxix-p2-s0">While the internal difficulties of our adolescent period
were being ironed out, public acceptance of A.A. grew by
leaps and bounds. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p2-s1">For this there were two principal
reasons: the large numbers of recoveries, and reunited
homes. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p2-s2">These made their impressions everywhere. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p2-s3">Of
alcoholics who came to A.A. and really tried, 50% got sober
at once and remained that way; 25% sobered up after some
relapses, and among the remainder, those who stayed on
with A.A. showed improvement. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p2-s4">Other thousands came to
a few A.A. meetings and at first decided they didn’t want
the program. </span>
                <span id="pgxix-p2-s5">But great numbers of these—about two out
of three—began to return as time passed. </span>

                <span id="pgxx-p0-s0">Another reason for the wide acceptance of A.A. was the
ministration of friends—friends in medicine, religion, and
the press, together with innumerable others who became
our able and persistent advocates. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p0-s1">Without such support,
A.A. could have made only the slowest progress. </span>

the recommendations of A.A.’s early medical and religious
friends will be found further on in this book. </span>

                <span id="pgxx-p1-s0">Alcoholics Anonymous is not a religious organization. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p1-s1">Neither does A.A. take any particular medical point of
view, though we cooperate widely with the men of
medicine as well as with the men of religion. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxx-p2">
                <span id="pgxx-p2-s0">Alcohol being no respecter of persons, we are an accurate
cross section of America, and in distant lands, the same
democratic evening-up process is now going on. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p2-s1">By
personal religious affiliation, we include Catho-lics,
Protestants, Jews, Hindus, and a sprinkling of Moslems and
Buddhists. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p2-s2">More than 15% of us are women. </span>

                <span id="pgxx-p3-s0">At present, our membership is pyramiding at the rate of
about twenty per cent a year. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p3-s1">So far, upon the total
problem of several million actual and potential alcoholics in
the world, we have made only a scratch. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p3-s2">In all probability,
we shall never be able to touch more than a fair fraction of
the alcohol problem in all its ramifications. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p3-s3">Upon therapy
for the alcoholic himself, we surely have no monopoly. </span>
                <span id="pgxx-p3-s4">Yet
it is our great hope that all those who have as yet found no
answer may begin to find one in the pages of this book and
will presently join us on the high road to a new freedom. </span>

                <span id="pgxxii-p1-s0">BY March 1976, when this edition went to the printer, the
total worldwide membership of Alcoholics Anonymous was
conservatively estimated at more than 1,000,000, with
almost 28,000 groups meeting in over 90 countries. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxxii-p2">
                <span id="pgxxii-p2-s0">Surveys of groups in the United States and Canada indicate
that A.A. is reaching out, not only to more and more
people, but to a wider and wider range. </span>
                <span id="pgxxii-p2-s1">Women now make
up more than one-fourth of the membership; among newer
members, the proportion is nearly one-third. </span>
                <span id="pgxxii-p2-s2">Seven
percent of the A.A.’s surveyed are less than 30 years of
age—among them, many in their teens. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pgxxii-p3">
                <span id="pgxxii-p3-s0">The basic principles of the A.A. program, it appears, hold
good for individuals with many different lifestyles, just as
the program has brought recovery to those of many
different nationalities. </span>
                <span id="pgxxii-p3-s1">The Twelve Steps that summarize
the program may be called los Doce Pasos in one country,
les Douze Etapes in another, but they trace exactly the
same path to recovery that was blazed by the earliest
members of Alcoholics Anonymous. </span>

            <p id="pgxxii-p4">
                <span id="pgxxii-p4-s0">In spite of the great increase in the size and the span of this
Fellowship, at its core it remains simple and personal. </span>
                <span id="pgxxii-p4-s1">Each
day, somewhere in the world, recovery begins when one
alcoholic talks with another alcoholic, sharing experience,
strength, and hope. </span>

                <span id="pgxxiii-p1-s0">THIS fourth edition of “Alcoholics Anonymous” came off
press in November 2001, at the start of a new millennium. </span>
                <span id="pgxxiii-p1-s1">Since the third edition was published in 1976, worldwide
membership of A.A. has just about doubled, to an
estimated two million or more, with nearly 100,800 groups
meeting in approximately 150 countries around the world. </span>

            <p id="pgxxiii-p2">
                <span id="pgxxiii-p2-s0">Literature has played a major role in A.A.’s growth, and a
striking phenomenon of the past quarter-century has been
the explosion of translations of our basic literature into
many languages and dialects. </span>
                <span id="pgxxiii-p2-s1">In country after country
where the A.A. seed was planted, it has taken root, slowly
at first, then growing by leaps and bounds when literature
has become available. </span>
                <span id="pgxxiii-p2-s2">Currently, “Alcoholics Anonymous”
has been translated into forty-three languages. </span>

people, it has also touched the lives of a vastly greater
variety of suffering alcoholics. </span>

people who normally would not mix” (page 17 of this book)
was written in 1939, it referred to a Fellowship composed
largely of men (and a few women) with quite similar social,
ethnic, and economic backgrounds. </span>

basic text, those words have proved to be far more visionary
than the founding members could ever have imagined. </span>

stories added to this edition represent a membership whose
characteristics—of age, gender, race, and culture—have
widened and have deepened to encompass virtually
everyone the first 100 members could have hoped to reach. </span>

message, sweeping changes in society as a whole are
reflected in new customs and practices within the

                <span id="pgxxx-p2-s0">The classification of alcoholics seems most difficult, and in much detail is outside the scope of this book. </span>

                <span id="pgxxx-p2-s2">We are all familiar with this type. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p2-s3">They are always "going on the wagon for keeps." </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p2-s4">They are over-remorseful and make many resolutions, but never a decision. </span>

                    <p id="pgxxx-p3">
                <span id="pgxxx-p3-s0">There is the type of man who is unwilling to admit that he cannot take a drink. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p3-s1">He plans various ways of drinking. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p3-s2">He changes his brand or his environment. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p3-s3">There is the type who always believes that after being entirely free from alcohol for a period of time he can take a drink without danger. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p3-s4">There is the manic-depressive type, who is, perhaps, the least understood by his friends, and about whom a whole chapter could be written. </span>

                <span id="pgxxx-p5-s0">All these, and many others, have one symptom in common: they cannot start drinking without developing the phenomenon of craving. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p5-s1">This phenomenon, as we have suggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy which differentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct entity. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p5-s2">It has never been, by any treatment with which we are familiar, permanently eradicated. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p5-s3">The only relief we have to suggest is entire abstinence. </span>

                <span id="pgxxx-p6-s0">This immediately precipitates us into a seething caldron of debate. </span>
                <span id="pgxxx-p6-s1">Much has been written pro and con, but among physicians, the general opinion seems to be that most chronic alcoholics are doomed. </span>

                <span id="pgxxxi-p0-s1">Perhaps I can best answer this by relating one of my experiences. </span>
                    </p>
                    <p id="pgxxxi-p1">
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s0">About one year prior to this experience a man was brought in to be treated for chronic alcoholism. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s1">He had but partially recovered from a gastric hemorrhage and seemed to be a case of pathological mental deterioration. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s2">He had lost everything worthwhile in life and was only living, one might say, to drink. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s3">He frankly admitted and believed that for him there was no hope. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s4">Following the elimination of alcohol, there was found to be no permanent brain injury. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s5">He accepted the plan outlined in this book. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s6">One year later he called to see me, and I experienced a very strange sensation. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s7">I knew the man by name, and partly recognized his features, but there all resemblance ended. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s8">From a trembling, despairing, nervous wreck, had emerged a man brimming over with self-reliance and contentment. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s9">I talked with him for some time, but was not able to bring myself to feel that I had known him before. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s10">To me he was a stranger, and so he left me. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p1-s11">A long time has passed with no return to alcohol. </span>
                    </p>
                    <p id="pgxxxi-p2">
                <span id="pgxxxi-p2-s0">When I need a mental uplift, I often think of another case brought in by a physician prominent in New York. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p2-s1">The patient had made his own diagnosis, and deciding his situation hopeless, had hidden in a deserted barn determined to die. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p2-s2">He was rescued by a searching party, and, in desperate condition, brought to me. </span>
                <span id="pgxxxi-p2-s3">Following his physical rehabilitation, he had a talk with me in which he frankly stated he thought the treatment a waste of effort, unless I could assure him, which no one ever had, that in the future he would have the "will power" to resist the impulse to drink. </span>
                    </p>
                    <p id="pgxxxi-p3">
                <span id="pgxxxi-p3-s0">His alcoholic problem was so complex, and his depression so great, that we felt his only hope would be through what we then called "moral psychology," and we doubted if even that would have any effect. </span>

                <span id="pg5-p1-s0">Liquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity. "Bathtub" gin, two bottles a day, and often three, got to be routine. </span>
                <span id="pg5-p1-s1">Sometimes a small deal would net a few hundred dollars, and I would pay my bills at the bars and delicatessens. </span>
                <span id="pg5-p1-s2">This went on endlessly, and I began to waken very early in the morning shaking violently. </span>
                <span id="pg5-p1-s3">A tumbler full of gin followed by half a dozen bottles of beer would be required if I were to eat any breakfast. </span>
                <span id="pg5-p1-s4">Nevertheless, I still thought I could control the situation, and there were periods of sobriety which renewed my wife's hope. </span>

                <span id="pg5-p3-s0">Then I got a promising business opportunity. </span>
                <span id="pg5-p3-s1">Stocks were at the low point of 1932, and I had somehow formed a group to buy. </span>
                <span id="pg5-p3-s2">I was to share generously in the profits. </span>
                <span id="pg5-p3-s3">Then I went on a prodigious bender, and that chance vanished. </span>

                <span id="pg5-p5-s0">Shortly afterward I came home drunk. </span>

                <span id="pg5-p5-s5">Someone had pushed a drink my way, and I had taken it. </span>

                <span id="pg6-p1-s2">My brain raced uncontrollably and there was a terrible sense of impending calamity. </span>
                <span id="pg6-p1-s3">I hardly dared cross the street, lest I collapse and be run down by an early morning truck, for it was scarcely daylight. </span>
                <span id="pg6-p1-s4">An all night place supplied me with a dozen glasses of ale. </span>
                <span id="pg6-p1-s5">My writhing nerves were stilled at last. </span>

                <span id="pg7-p1-s3">Best of all, I met a kind doctor who explained that though certainly selfish and foolish, I had been seriously ill, bodily and mentally. </span>

                <span id="pg7-p2-s0">It relieved me somewhat to learn that in alcoholics the will is amazingly weakened when it comes to combating liquor, though it often remains strong in other respects. </span>

                <span id="pg9-p0-s1">It was years since I could remember his coming to New York in that condition. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p0-s2">I was amazed. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p0-s3">Rumor had it that he had been committed for alcoholic insanity. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p0-s4">I wondered how he had escaped. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p0-s5">Of course he would have dinner, and then I could drink openly with him. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p0-s6">Unmindful of his welfare, I thought only of recapturing the spirit of other days. </span>

                <span id="pg9-p0-s8">His coming was an oasis in this dreary desert of futility. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p0-s9">The very thing - an oasis! </span>
                <span id="pg9-p0-s10">Drinkers are like that. </span>

            <p id="pg9-p1">
                <span id="pg9-p1-s0">The door opened and he stood there, fresh-skinned and glowing. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p1-s1">There was something about his eyes. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p1-s2">He was inexplicably different. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p1-s3">What had happened? </span>

            <p id="pg9-p2">
                <span id="pg9-p2-s0">I pushed a drink across the table. </span>

                <span id="pg9-p3-s1">I queried. </span>

                <span id="pg9-p4-s0">He looked straight at me. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p4-s1">Simply, but smilingly, he said, "I've got religion." </span>

                <span id="pg9-p5-s0">I was aghast. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p5-s1">So that was it - last summer an alcoholic crackpot; now, I suspected, a little cracked about religion. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p5-s2">He had that starry-eyed look. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p5-s3">Yes, the old boy was on fire all right. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p5-s4">But bless his heart, let him rant! </span>
                <span id="pg9-p5-s5">Besides, my gin would last longer than his preaching. </span>

            <p id="pg9-p6">
                <span id="pg9-p6-s0">But he did no ranting. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p6-s1">In a matter of fact way he told how two men had appeared in court, persuading the judge to suspend his commitment. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p6-s2">They had told of a simple religious idea and a practical program of action. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p6-s3">That was two months ago and the result was self-evident. </span>
                <span id="pg9-p6-s4">It worked! </span>

                <span id="pg10-p0-s2">Certainly I was interested. </span>

                <span id="pg10-p1-s2">I could almost hear the sound of the preacher's voice as I sat, on still Sundays, way over there on the hillside; there was that proffered temperance pledge I never signed; my grandfather's good natured contempt of some church folk and their doings; his insistence that the spheres really had their music; but his denial of the preacher's right to tell him how he must listen; his fearlessness as he spoke of these things just before he died; these recollections welled up from the past. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p1-s3">They made me swallow hard. </span>

                <span id="pg10-p3-s1">I had often pondered these things. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p3-s2">I was not an atheist. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p3-s3">Few people really are, for that means blind faith in the strange proposition that this universe originated in a cipher and aimlessly rushes nowhere. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p3-s4">My intellectual heroes, the chemists, the astronomers, even the evolutionists, suggested vast laws and forces at work. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p3-s5">Despite contrary indications, I had little doubt that a mighty purpose and rhythm underlay all. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p3-s6">How could there be so much of precise and immutable law, and no intelligence? </span>
                <span id="pg10-p3-s7">I simply had to believe in a Spirit of the Universe, who knew neither time nor limitation. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p3-s8">But that was as far as I had gone. </span>

                <span id="pg10-p4-s0">With ministers, and the world's religions, I parted right there. </span>
                <span id="pg10-p4-s1">When they talked of a God personal to me, who was love, superhuman strength and direction, I became irritated and my mind snapped shut against such a theory. </span>

                <span id="pg11-p1-s1">I honestly doubted whether, on balance, the religions of mankind had done any good. </span>
                <span id="pg11-p1-s2">Judging from what I had seen in Europe and since, the power of God in human affairs was negligible, the Brotherhood of Man a grim jest. </span>

                <span id="pg11-p2-s0">But my friend sat before me, and he made the point-blank declaration that God had done for him what he could not do for himself. </span>

                <span id="pg11-p2-s4">Like myself, he had admitted complete defeat. </span>
                <span id="pg11-p2-s5">Then he had, in effect, been raised from the dead, suddenly taken from the scrap heap to a level of life better than the best he had ever known! </span>

            <p id="pg11-p3">
                <span id="pg11-p3-s0">Had this power originated in him? </span>
                <span id="pg11-p3-s1">Obviously it had not. </span>
                <span id="pg11-p3-s2">There had been no more power in him than there was in me at the minute; and this was none at all. </span>

                <span id="pg11-p4-s4">Never mind the musty past; here sat a miracle directly across the kitchen table. </span>

                <span id="pg25-p1-s0"><em>There is a solution.</em> Almost none of us liked the self-searching, the leveling of our pride, the confession of shortcomings which the process requires for its successful consummation. </span>
                <span id="pg25-p1-s1">But we saw that it really worked in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life as we had been living it. </span>
                <span id="pg25-p1-s2">When, therefore, we were approached by those in whom the problem had been solved, there was nothing left for us but to pick up the simple kit of spiritual tools laid at our feet. </span>
                <span id="pg25-p1-s3">We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed. </span>

                <span id="pg25-p2-s0">The great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God's universe. </span>
                <span id="pg25-p2-s1">The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way which is indeed miraculous. </span>
                <span id="pg25-p2-s2">He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do by ourselves. </span>

                <span id="pg25-p3-s1">We were in a position where life was becoming impossible, and if we had passed into the region from which there is no return through human aid, we had but two alternatives: One was to go on to the bitter end, blotting out the consciousness of our intolerable situation as best we could; and the other, to accept spiritual help. </span>

                <span id="pg26-p0-s0">we did because we honestly wanted to, and were willing to make the effort. </span>

            <p id="pg26-p1">
                <span id="pg26-p1-s0">A certain American business man had ability, good sense, and high character. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s1">For years he had floundered from one sanitarium to another. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s2">He had consulted the best known American psychiatrists. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s3">Then he had gone to Europe, placing himself in the care of a celebrated physician (the psychiatrist, Dr. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s4">Jung) who prescribed for him. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s5">Though experience had made him skeptical, he finished his treatment with unusual confidence. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s6">His physical and mental condition were unusually good. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s7">Above all, he believed he had acquired such a profound knowledge of the inner workings of his mind and its hidden springs that relapse was unthinkable. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s8">Nevertheless, he was drunk in a short time. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p1-s9">More baffling still, he could give himself no satisfactory explanation for his fall. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg26-p2">
                <span id="pg26-p2-s0">So he returned to this doctor, whom he admired, and asked him point-blank why he could not recover. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p2-s1">He wished above all things to regain self-control. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p2-s2">He seemed quite rational and well-balanced with respect to other problems. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p2-s3">Yet he had no control whatever over alcohol. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p2-s4">Why was this? </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg26-p3">
                <span id="pg26-p3-s0">He begged the doctor to tell him the whole truth, and he got it. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p3-s1">In the doctor's judgment he was utterly hopeless; he could never regain his position in society and he would have to place himself under lock and key or hire a bodyguard if he expected to live long. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p3-s2">That was a great physician's opinion. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg26-p4">
                <span id="pg26-p4-s0">But this man still lives, and is a free man. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p4-s1">He does not need a bodyguard nor is he confined. </span>
                <span id="pg26-p4-s2">He can go anywhere on this earth where other free men may go </span>

            <p id="pg27-p1">
                <span id="pg27-p1-s0">Some of our alcoholic readers may think they can do without spiritual help. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p1-s1">Let us tell you the rest of the conversation our friend had with his doctor. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg27-p2">
                <span id="pg27-p2-s0">The doctor said: "You have the mind of a chronic alcoholic. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p2-s1">I have never seen one single case recover, where that state of mind existed to the extent that it does in you." </span>
                <span id="pg27-p2-s2">Our friend felt as though the gates of hell had closed on him with a clang. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg27-p3">
                <span id="pg27-p3-s0">He said to the doctor, "Is there no exception?" </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg27-p4">
                <span id="pg27-p4-s0">"Yes," replied the doctor, "there is. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p4-s1">Exceptions to cases such as yours have been occurring since early times. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p4-s2">Here and there, once in a while, alcoholics have had what are called vital spiritual experiences. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p4-s3">To me these occurrences are phenomena. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p4-s4">They appear to be in the nature of huge emotional displacements and rearrangements. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p4-s5">Ideas, emotions, and attitudes which were once the guiding forces of the lives of these men are suddenly cast to one side, and a completely new set of conceptions and motives begin to dominate them. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p4-s6">In fact, I have been trying to produce some such emotional rearrangement within you. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p4-s7">With many individuals the methods which I employed are successful, but I have never been successful with an alcoholic of your description." </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg27-p5">
                <span id="pg27-p5-s0">Upon hearing this, our friend was somewhat relieved, for he reflected that, after all, he was a good church member. </span>
                <span id="pg27-p5-s1">This hope, however, was destroyed by the doctor's telling him that while his religious convictions were very good, in his case they did not spell the necessary vital spiritual experience. </span>

                <span id="pg28-p3-s0">We think it no concern of ours what religious bodies our members identify themselves with as individuals. </span>
                <span id="pg28-p3-s1">This should be an entirely personal affair which each one decides for himself in the light of past associations, or his present choice. </span>

                <span id="pg32-p1-s0">Though there is no way of proving it, we believe that early in our drinking careers most of us could have stopped drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p1-s1">But the difficulty is that few alcoholics have enough desire to stop while there is yet time. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p1-s2">We have heard of a few instances where people, who showed definite signs of alcoholism, were able to stop for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do so. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p1-s3">Here is one. </span>

                <span id="pg32-p2-s0">A man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s1">He was very nervous in the morning after these bouts and quieted himself with more liquor. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s2">He was ambitious to succeed in business, but saw that he would get nowhere if he drank at all. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s3">Once he started, he had no control whatever. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s4">He made up his mind that until he had been successful in business and had retired, he would not touch another drop. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s5">An exceptional man, he remained bone dry for twenty-five years and retired at the age of fifty-five, after a successful and happy business career. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s6">Then he fell victim to a belief which practically every alcoholic has - that his long period of sobriety and self-discipline had qualified him to drink as other men. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s7">Out came his carpet slippers and a bottle. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s8">In two months he was in a hospital, puzzled and humiliated. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s9">He tried to regulate his drinking for a while, making several trips to the hospital meantime. </span>
                <span id="pg32-p2-s10">Then, gathering all his forces, he attempted to stop altogether and found he could not. </span>

                <span id="pg33-p1-s1">Most of us have believed that if we remained sober for a long stretch, we could thereafter drink normally. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p1-s2">But here is a man who at fifty-five years found he was just where he had left off at thirty. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p1-s3">We have seen the truth demonstrated again and again: "Once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic." </span>
                <span id="pg33-p1-s4">Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in a short time as bad as ever. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p1-s5">If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be no reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be immune to alcohol. </span>

                <span id="pg33-p2-s0">Young people may be encouraged by this man's experience to think that they can stop, as he did, on their own will power. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p2-s1">We doubt if many of them can do it, because none will really want to stop, and hardly one of them, because of the peculiar mental twist already acquired, will find he can win out. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p2-s2">Several of our crowd, men of thirty or less, had been drinking only a few years, but they found themselves as helpless as those who had been drinking twenty years. </span>

            <p id="pg33-p3">
                <span id="pg33-p3-s0">To be gravely affected, one does not necessarily have to drink a long time nor take the quantities some of us have. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p3-s1">This is particularly true of women. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p3-s2">Potential female alcoholics often turn into the real thing and are gone beyond recall in a few years. </span>
                <span id="pg33-p3-s3">Certain drinkers, who would be greatly insulted if called alcoholics, are astonished at their inability to stop. </span>

                <span id="pg34-p1-s3">In the early days of our drinking we occasionally remained sober for a year or more, becoming serious drinkers again later. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p1-s4">Though you may be able to stop for a considerable period, you may yet be a potential alcoholic. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p1-s5">We think few, to whom this book will appeal, can stay dry anything like a year. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p1-s6">Some will be drunk the day after making their resolutions; most of them within a few weeks. </span>

                <span id="pg34-p2-s0">For those who are unable to drink moderately the question is how to stop altogether. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p2-s1">We are assuming, of course, that the reader desires to stop. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p2-s2">Whether such a person can quit upon a nonspiritual basis depends upon the extent to which he has already lost the power to choose whether he will drink or not. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p2-s3">Many of us felt that we had plenty of character. </span>

                <span id="pg34-p2-s5">Yet we found it impossible. </span>
                <span id="pg34-p2-s6">This is the baffling feature of alcoholism as we know it - this utter inability to leave it alone, no matter how great the necessity or the wish. </span>

                <span id="pg35-p2-s8">In a few years he became so violent when intoxicated that he had to be committed. </span>

                <span id="pg36-p0-s7">I had no intention of drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg36-p0-s8">I just thought I would get a sandwich. </span>
                <span id="pg36-p0-s9">I also had the notion that I might find a customer for a car at this place, which was familiar for I had been going to it for years. </span>
                <span id="pg36-p0-s10">I had eaten there many times during the months I was sober. </span>
                <span id="pg36-p0-s11">I sat down at a table and ordered a sandwich and a glass of milk. </span>
                <span id="pg36-p0-s12">Still no thought of drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg36-p0-s13">I ordered another sandwich and decided to have another glass of milk. </span>

                <span id="pg39-p2-s6">We first saw Fred about a year ago in a hospital where he had gone to recover from a bad case of jitters. </span>
                <span id="pg39-p2-s7">It was his first experience of this kind, and he was much ashamed of it. </span>
                <span id="pg39-p2-s8">Far from admitting he was an alcoholic, he told himself he came to the hospital to rest his nerves. </span>
                <span id="pg39-p2-s9">The doctor intimated strongly that he might be worse than he realized. </span>

                <span id="pg39-p2-s12">It never occurred to him that perhaps he could not do so, in spite of his character and standing. </span>

                <span id="pg43-p1-s3">Most alcoholics have to be pretty badly mangled before they really commence to solve their problems. </span>

            <p id="pg43-p2">
                <span id="pg43-p2-s0">Many doctors and psychiatrists agree with our conclusions. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p2-s1">One of these men, staff member of a world-renowned hospital, recently made this statement to some of us: "What you say about the general hopelessness of the average alcoholic's plight is, in my opinion, correct. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p2-s2">As to two of you men, whose stories I have heard, there is no doubt in my mind that you were 100% hopeless, apart from divine help. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p2-s3">Had you offered yourselves as patients at this hospital, I would not have taken you, if I had been able to avoid it. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p2-s4">People like you are too heartbreaking. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p2-s5">Though not a religious person, I have profound respect for the spiritual approach in such cases as yours. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p2-s6">For most cases, there is virtually no other solution." </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg43-p3">
                <span id="pg43-p3-s0">Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p3-s1">Except in a few rare cases, neither he nor any other human being can provide such a defense. </span>
                <span id="pg43-p3-s2">His defense must come from a Higher Power. </span>

                <span id="pg44-p2-s0">In the preceding chapters you have learned something of alcoholism. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p2-s1">We hope we have made clear the distinction between the alcoholic and the nonalcoholic. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p2-s2">If, when you honestly want to, you find you cannot quit entirely, or if when drinking, you have little control over the amount you take, you are probably alcoholic. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p2-s3">If that be the case, you may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer. </span>

            <p id="pg44-p3">
                <span id="pg44-p3-s0">To one who feels he is an atheist or agnostic such an experience seems impossible, but to continue as he is means disaster, especially if he is an alcoholic of the hopeless variety. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p3-s1">To be doomed to an alcoholic death or to live on a spiritual basis are not always easy alternatives to face. </span>

            <p id="pg44-p4">
                <span id="pg44-p4-s0">But it isn't so difficult. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p4-s1">About half our original fellowship were of exactly that type. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p4-s2">At first some of us tried to avoid the issue, hoping against hope we were not true alcoholics. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p4-s3">But after a while we had to face the fact that we must find a spiritual basis of life - or else. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p4-s4">Perhaps it is going to be that way with you. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p4-s5">But cheer up, something like half of us thought we were atheists or agnostics. </span>
                <span id="pg44-p4-s6">Our experience shows that you need not be disconcerted. </span>

                <span id="pg45-p0-s1">But we found that such codes and philosophies did not save us, no matter how much we tried. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p0-s2">We could wish to be moral, we could wish to be philosophically comforted, in fact, we could will these things with all our might, but the needed power wasn't there. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p0-s3">Our human resources, as marshalled by the will, were not sufficient; they failed utterly. </span>

            <p id="pg45-p1">
                <span id="pg45-p1-s0">Lack of power, that was our dilemma. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p1-s1">We had to find a power by which we could live, and it had to be a <em>Power greater than ourselves.</em> Obviously. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p1-s2">But where and how were we to find this Power? </span>

            <p id="pg45-p2">
                <span id="pg45-p2-s0">Well, that's exactly what this book is about. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p2-s1">Its main object is to enable you to find a Power greater than yourself which will solve your problem. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p2-s2">That means we have written a book which we believe to be spiritual as well as moral. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p2-s3">And it means, of course, that we are going to talk about God. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p2-s4">Here difficulty arises with agnostics. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p2-s5">Many times we talk to a new man and watch his hope rise as we discuss his alcoholic problems and explain our fellowship. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p2-s6">But his face falls when we speak of spiritual matters, especially when we mention God, for we have re-opened a subject which our man thought he had neatly evaded or entirely ignored. </span>

            <p id="pg45-p3">

                <span id="pg45-p3-s2">Some of us have been violently anti-religious. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p3-s3">To others, the word "God" brought up a particular idea of Him with which someone had tried to impress them during childhood. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p3-s4">Perhaps we rejected this particular conception because it seemed inadequate. </span>
                <span id="pg45-p3-s5">With that rejection we imagined we had abandoned the God idea entirely. </span>

                <span id="pg46-p0-s1">We looked upon this world of warring individuals, warring theological systems, and inexplicable calamity, with deep skepticism. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p0-s2">We looked askance at many individuals who claimed to be godly. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p0-s3">How could a Supreme Being have anything to do with it all? </span>
                <span id="pg46-p0-s4">And who could comprehend a Supreme Being anyhow? </span>
                <span id="pg46-p0-s5">Yet, in other moments, we found ourselves thinking, when enchanted by a starlit night, "Who, then, made all this?" </span>
                <span id="pg46-p0-s6">There was a feeling of awe and wonder, but it was fleeting and soon lost. </span>

            <p id="pg46-p1">
                <span id="pg46-p1-s0">Yes, we of agnostic temperament have had these thoughts and experiences. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p1-s1">Let us make haste to reassure you. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p1-s2">We found that as soon as we were able to lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a Power greater than ourselves, we commenced to get results, even though it was impossible for any of us to fully define or comprehend that Power, which is God. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg46-p2">
                <span id="pg46-p2-s0">Much to our relief, we discovered we did not need to consider another's conception of God. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s1">Our own conception, however inadequate, was sufficient to make the approach and to effect a contact with Him. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s2">As soon as we admitted the possible existence of a Creative Intelligence, a Spirit of the Universe underlying the totality of things, we began to be possessed of a new sense of power and direction, provided we took other simple steps. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s3">We found that God does not make too hard terms with those who seek Him. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s4">To us, the Realm of Spirit is broad, roomy, all inclusive; never exclusive or forbidding to those who earnestly seek. </span>
                <span id="pg46-p2-s5">It is open, we believe, to all men. </span>

                <span id="pg47-p0-s0">When, therefore, we speak to you of God, we mean your own conception of God. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p0-s1">This applies, too, to other spiritual expressions which you find in this book. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p0-s2">Do not let any prejudice you may have against spiritual terms deter you from honestly asking yourself what they mean to you. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p0-s3">At the start, this was all we needed to commence spiritual growth, to effect our first conscious relation with God as we understood Him. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p0-s4">Afterward, we found ourselves accepting many things which then seemed entirely out of reach. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p0-s5">That was growth, but if we wished to grow we had to begin somewhere. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p0-s6">So we used our own conception, however limited it was. </span>

            <p id="pg47-p1">
                <span id="pg47-p1-s0">We needed to ask ourselves but one short question. "Do I now believe, or am I even willing to believe, that there is a Power greater than myself?" </span>
                <span id="pg47-p1-s1">As soon as a man can say that he does believe, or is willing to believe, we emphatically assure him that he is on his way. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p1-s2">It has been repeatedly proven among us that upon this simple cornerstone a wonderfully effective spiritual structure can be built. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg47-p2">
                <span id="pg47-p2-s0">That was great news to us, for we had assumed we could not make use of spiritual principles unless we accepted many things on faith which seemed difficult to believe. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p2-s1">When people presented us with spiritual approaches, how frequently did we all say, "I wish I had what that man has. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p2-s2">I'm sure it would work if I could only believe as he believes. </span>
                <span id="pg47-p2-s3">But I cannot accept as surely true the many articles of faith which are so plain to him." </span>
                <span id="pg47-p2-s4">So it was comforting to learn that we could commence at a simpler level. </span>

                <span id="pg48-p2-s1">Nevertheless, the twentieth century readily accepts theories of all kinds, provided they are firmly grounded in fact. </span>
                <span id="pg48-p2-s2">We have numerous theories, for example, about electricity. </span>
                <span id="pg48-p2-s3">Everybody believes them without a murmur of doubt. </span>
                <span id="pg48-p2-s4">Why this ready acceptance? </span>
                <span id="pg48-p2-s5">Simply because it is impossible to explain what we see, feel, direct, and use, without a reasonable assumption as a starting point. </span>

            <p id="pg48-p3">
                <span id="pg48-p3-s0">Everybody nowadays, believes in scores of assumptions for which there is good evidence, but no perfect visual proof. </span>
                <span id="pg48-p3-s1">And does not science demonstrate that visual proof is the weakest proof? </span>
                <span id="pg48-p3-s2">It is being constantly revealed, as mankind studies the material world, that outward appearances are not inward reality at all. </span>

                <span id="pg56-p0-s1">He attended church school, where he became rebellious at what he thought an overdose of religious education. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p0-s2">For years thereafter he was dogged by trouble and frustration. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p0-s3">Business failure, insanity, fatal illness, suicide - these calamities in his immediate family embittered and depressed him. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p0-s4">Post-war disillusionment, ever more serious alcoholism, impending mental and physical collapse, brought him to the point of self-destruction. </span>

                <span id="pg56-p1-s0">One night, when confined in a hospital, he was approached by an alcoholic who had known a spiritual experience. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p1-s1">Our friend's gorge rose as he bitterly cried out: "If there is a God, He certainly hasn't done anything for me!" </span>
                <span id="pg56-p1-s2">But later, alone in his room, he asked himself this question: "Is it possible that all the religious people I have known are wrong?" </span>
                <span id="pg56-p1-s3">While pondering the answer he felt as though he lived in hell. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p1-s4">Then, like a thunderbolt, a great thought came. </span>

                <span id="pg56-p5-s1">In a few seconds he was overwhelmed by a conviction of the Presence of God. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p5-s2">It poured over and through him with the certainty and majesty of a great tide at flood. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p5-s3">The barriers he had built through the years were swept away. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p5-s4">He stood in the Presence of Infinite Power and Love. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p5-s5">He had stepped from bridge to shore. </span>
                <span id="pg56-p5-s6">For the first time, he lived in conscious companionship with his Creator. </span>

                <span id="pg61-p1-s1">The show doesn't come off very well. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s2">He begins to think life doesn't treat him right. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s3">He decides to exert himself more. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s4">He becomes, on the next occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the case may be. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s5">Still the play does not suit him. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s6">Admitting he may be somewhat at fault, he is sure that other people are more to blame. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s7">He becomes angry, indignant, self-pitying. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s8">What is his basic trouble? </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s9">Is he not really a self-seeker even when trying to be kind? </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s10">Is he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction and happiness out of this world if he only manages well? </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s11">Is it not evident to all the rest of the players that these are the things he wants? </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s12">And do not his actions make each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of the show? </span>
                <span id="pg61-p1-s13">Is he not, even in his best moments, a producer of confusion rather than harmony? </span>

            <p id="pg61-p2">
                <span id="pg61-p2-s0">Our actor is self-centered - ego-centric, as people like to call it nowadays. </span>
                <span id="pg61-p2-s1">He is like the retired business man who lolls in the Florida sunshine in the winter complaining of the sad state of the nation; the minister who sighs over the sins of the twentieth century; politicians and reformers who are sure all would be Utopia </span>

            <p id="pg62-p0">
                <span id="pg62-p0-s0">if the rest of the world would only behave; the outlaw safe cracker who thinks society has wronged him; and the alcoholic who has lost all and is locked up. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p0-s1">Whatever our protestations, are not most of us concerned with ourselves, our resentments, or our self-pity? </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg62-p1">
                <span id="pg62-p1-s0">Selfishness - self-centeredness! </span>
                <span id="pg62-p1-s1">That, we think, is the root of our troubles. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p1-s2">Driven by a hundred forms of fear, self-delusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes of our fellows and they retaliate. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p1-s3">Sometimes they hurt us, seemingly without provocation, but we invariably find that at some time in the past we have made decisions based on self which later placed us in a position to be hurt. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg62-p2">
                <span id="pg62-p2-s0">So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s1">They arise out of ourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though he usually doesn't think so. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s2">Above everything, we alcoholics must be rid of this selfishness. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s3">We must, or it kills us! </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s4">God makes that possible. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s5">And there often seems no way of entirely getting rid of self without His aid. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s6">Many of us had moral and philosophical convictions galore, but we could not live up to them even though we would have liked to. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s7">Neither could we reduce our self-centeredness much by wishing or trying on our own power. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p2-s8">We had to have God's help. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg62-p3">
                <span id="pg62-p3-s0">This is the how and why of it. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p3-s1">First of all, we had to quit playing God. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p3-s2">It didn't work. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p3-s3">Next, we decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going to be our Director. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p3-s4">He is the Principal; we are His agents. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p3-s5">He is the Father, and we are His children. </span>
                <span id="pg62-p3-s6">Most good ideas are simple, and this concept was the keystone of the new and triumphant arch through which we passed to freedom. </span>

                <span id="pg63-p0-s1">We had a new Employer. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p0-s2">Being all powerful, He provided what we needed, if we kept close to Him and performed His work well. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p0-s3">Established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p0-s4">More and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p0-s5">As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully, as we became conscious of His presence, we began to lose our fear of today, tomorrow or the hereafter. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p0-s6">We were reborn. </span>

                <span id="pg63-p1-s1">Many of us said to our Maker, _as we understood Him: "_God, I offer myself to Thee-to build with me and to do with me as Thou wilt. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p1-s2">Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p1-s3">Take away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I would help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p1-s4">May I do Thy will always!" </span>
                <span id="pg63-p1-s5">We thought well before taking this step making sure we were ready; that we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg63-p2">
                <span id="pg63-p2-s0">We found it very desirable to take this spiritual step with an understanding person, such as our wife, best friend or spiritual adviser. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p2-s1">But it is better to meet God alone than with one who might misunderstand. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p2-s2">The wording was, of course, quite optional so long as we expressed the idea, voicing it without reservation. </span>
                <span id="pg63-p2-s3">This was only a beginning, though if honestly and humbly made, an effect, sometimes a very great one, was felt at once. </span>

                <span id="pg64-p0-s1">Though our decision was a vital and crucial step, it could have little permanent effect unless at once followed by a strenuous effort to face, and to be rid of, the things in ourselves which had been blocking us. </span>

            <p id="pg64-p1">
                <span id="pg64-p1-s0">Therefore, we started upon a personal inventory. <em>This was Step Four</em>. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p1-s1">A business which takes no regular inventory usually goes broke. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p1-s2">Taking a commercial inventory is a fact-finding and a fact-facing process. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p1-s3">It is an effort to discover the truth about the stock-in-trade. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p1-s4">One object is to disclose damaged or unsalable goods, to get rid of them promptly and without regret. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p1-s5">If the owner of the business is to be successful, he cannot fool himself about values. </span>

                <span id="pg64-p2-s2">First, we searched out the flaws in our make-up which caused our failure. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p2-s3">Being convinced that self, manifested in various ways, was what had defeated us, we considered its common manifestations. </span>

            <p id="pg64-p3">
                <span id="pg64-p3-s0">Resentment is the "number one" offender. </span>

                <span id="pg64-p3-s2">From it stem all forms of spiritual disease, for we have been not only mentally and physically ill, we have been spiritually sick. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p3-s3">When the spiritual malady is overcome, we straighten out mentally and physically. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p3-s4">In dealing with resentments, we set them on paper. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p3-s5">We listed people, institutions or principles with whom we were angry. </span>
                <span id="pg64-p3-s6">We asked ourselves why we were angry. </span>

                <span id="pg66-p1-s2">But with the alcoholic, whose hope is the maintenance and growth of a spiritual experience, this business of resentment is infinitely grave. </span>
                <span id="pg66-p1-s3">We found that it is fatal. </span>

                <span id="pg66-p3-s3">In that state, the wrong-doing of others, fancied or real, had power to actually kill. </span>

                <span id="pg78-p1-s3">Our former enemies sometimes praise what we are doing and wish us well. </span>
                <span id="pg78-p1-s4">Occasionally, they will offer assistance. </span>
                <span id="pg78-p1-s5">It should not matter, however, if someone does throw us out of his office. </span>
                <span id="pg78-p1-s6">We have made our demonstration, done our part. </span>

                <span id="pg78-p2-s2">Telling them what we are trying to do, we make no bones about our drinking; they usually know it anyway, whether we think so or not. </span>
                <span id="pg78-p2-s3">Nor are we afraid of disclosing our alcoholism on the theory it may cause financial harm. </span>
                <span id="pg78-p2-s4">Approached in this way, the most ruthless creditor will sometimes surprise us. </span>
                <span id="pg78-p2-s5">Arranging the best deal we can we let these people know we are sorry. </span>
                <span id="pg78-p2-s6">Our drinking has made us slow to pay. </span>

                <span id="pg79-p1-s0">Although these reparations take innumerable forms, there are some general principles which we find guiding. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p1-s1">Reminding ourselves that we have decided to go to any lengths to find a spiritual experience, we ask that we be given strength and direction to do the right thing, no matter what the personal consequences may be. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p1-s2">We may lose our position or reputation or face jail, but we are willing. </span>

                <span id="pg79-p2-s3">Because of resentment and drinking, he had not paid alimony to his first wife. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p2-s4">She was furious. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p2-s5">She went to court and got an order for his arrest. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p2-s6">He had commenced our way of life, had secured a position, and was getting his head above water. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p2-s7">It would have been impressive heroics if he had walked up to the Judge and said, "Here I am." </span>

            <p id="pg79-p3">
                <span id="pg79-p3-s0">We thought he ought to be willing to do that if necessary, but if he were in jail he could provide nothing for either family. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p3-s1">We suggested he write his first wife admitting his faults and asking forgiveness. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p3-s2">He did, and also sent a small amount of money. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p3-s3">He told her what he would try to do in the future. </span>
                <span id="pg79-p3-s4">He said he was perfectly willing to go to jail if she insisted. </span>

                <span id="pg80-p1-s0">This brings to mind a story about one of our friends. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p1-s1">While drinking, he accepted a sum of money from a bitterly-hated business rival, giving him no receipt for it. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p1-s2">He subsequently denied having received the money and used the incident as a basis for discrediting the man. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p1-s3">He thus used his own wrong-doing as a means of destroying the reputation of another. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p1-s4">In fact, his rival was ruined. </span>

                <span id="pg80-p2-s0">He felt that he had done a wrong he could not possibly make right. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p2-s1">If he opened that old affair, he was afraid it would destroy the reputation of his partner, disgrace his family and take away his means of livelihood. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p2-s2">What right had he to involve those dependent upon him? </span>
                <span id="pg80-p2-s3">How could he possibly make a public statement exonerating his rival? </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg80-p3">
                <span id="pg80-p3-s0">After consulting with his wife and partner he came to the conclusion that is was better to take those risks than to stand before his Creator guilty of such ruinous slander. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p3-s1">He saw that he had to place the outcome in God's hands or he would soon start drinking again, and all would be lost anyhow. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p3-s2">He attended church for the first time in many years. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p3-s3">After the sermon, he quietly got up and made an explanation. </span>
                <span id="pg80-p3-s4">His action met wide-spread approval, and today he is one of the most trusted citizens of his town. </span>

                <span id="pg81-p0-s2">But drinking does complicate sex relations in the home. </span>
                <span id="pg81-p0-s3">After a few years with an alcoholic, a wife gets worn out, resentful and uncommunicative. </span>

                <span id="pg81-p0-s5">The husband begins to feel lonely, sorry for himself. </span>
                <span id="pg81-p0-s6">He commences to look around in the night clubs, or their equivalent, for something besides liquor. </span>

                <span id="pg81-p0-s9">A man so involved often feels very remorseful at times, especially if he is married to a loyal and courageous girl who has literally gone through hell for him. </span>

                <span id="pg81-p1-s3">If she knows in a general way that we have been wild, should we tell her in detail? </span>
                <span id="pg81-p1-s4">Undoubtedly we should admit our fault. </span>
                <span id="pg81-p1-s5">She may insist on knowing all the particulars. </span>
                <span id="pg81-p1-s6">She will want to know who the woman is and where she is. </span>
                <span id="pg81-p1-s7">We feel we ought to say to her that we have no right to involve another person. </span>

                <span id="pg82-p2-s2">Certainly he must keep sober, for there will be no home if he doesn't. </span>
                <span id="pg82-p2-s3">But he is yet a long way from making good to the wife or parents whom for years he has so shockingly treated. </span>
                <span id="pg82-p2-s4">Passing all understanding is the patience mothers and wives have had with alcoholics. </span>

                <span id="pg89-p2-s0">Practical experience shows that nothing will so much insure immunity from drinking as intensive work with other alcoholics. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p2-s1">It works when other activities fail. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p2-s2">This is our <em>twelfth suggestion</em>: Carry this message to other alcoholics! </span>
                <span id="pg89-p2-s3">You can help when no one else can. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p2-s4">You can secure their confidence when others fail. </span>

                <span id="pg89-p3-s1">To watch people recover, to see them help others, to watch loneliness vanish, to see a fellowship grow up about you, to have a host of friends - this is an experience you must not miss. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p3-s2">We know you will not want to miss it. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p3-s3">Frequent contact with newcomers and with each other is the bright spot of our lives. </span>

                <span id="pg89-p4-s0">Perhaps you are not acquainted with any drinkers who want to recover. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p4-s1">You can easily find some by asking a few doctors, ministers, priests or hospitals. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p4-s2">They will be only too glad to assist you. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p4-s3">Don't start out as an evangelist or reformer. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p4-s4">Unfortunately a lot of prejudice exists. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p4-s5">You will be handicapped if you arouse it. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p4-s6">Ministers and doctors are competent and you can learn much from them if you wish, but it happens that because of your own drinking experience you can be uniquely useful to other alcoholics. </span>
                <span id="pg89-p4-s7">So cooperate; never criticize. </span>

                <span id="pg90-p0-s0">When you discover a prospect for Alcoholics Anonymous, find out all you can about him. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p0-s1">If he does not want to stop drinking, don't waste time trying to persuade him. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p0-s2">You may spoil a later opportunity. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p0-s3">This advice is given for his family also. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p0-s4">They should be patient, realizing they are dealing with a sick person. </span>

            <p id="pg90-p1">
                <span id="pg90-p1-s0">If there is any indication that he wants to stop, have a good talk with the person most interested in him - usually his wife. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p1-s1">Get an idea of his behavior, his problems, his background, the seriousness of his condition, and his religious leanings. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p1-s2">You need this information to put yourself in his place, to see how you would like him to approach you if the tables were turned. </span>

            <p id="pg90-p2">
                <span id="pg90-p2-s0">Sometimes it is wise to wait till he goes on a binge. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p2-s1">The family may object to this, but unless he is in a dangerous physical condition, it is better to risk it. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p2-s2">Don't deal with him when he is very drunk, unless he is ugly and the family needs your help. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p2-s3">Wait for the end of the spree, or at least for a lucid interval. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p2-s4">Then let his family or a friend ask him if he wants to quit for good and if he would go to any extreme to do so. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p2-s5">If he says yes, then his attention should be drawn to you as a person who has recovered. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p2-s6">You should be described to him as one of a fellowship who, as part of their own recovery, try to help others and who will be glad to talk to him if he cares to see you. </span>

            <p id="pg90-p3">
                <span id="pg90-p3-s0">If he does not want to see you, never force yourself upon him. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p3-s1">Neither should the family hysterically plead with him to do anything, nor should they tell him much about you. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p3-s2">They should wait for the end of his next drinking bout. </span>
                <span id="pg90-p3-s3">You might place this book where he can see it in the interval. </span>

                <span id="pg91-p3-s2">After a while, turn the talk to some phase of drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg91-p3-s3">Tell him enough about your drinking habits, symptoms, and experiences to encourage him to speak of himself. </span>

                <span id="pg91-p3-s5">You will thus get a better idea of how you ought to proceed. </span>
                <span id="pg91-p3-s6">If he is not communicative, give him a sketch of your drinking career up to the time you quit. </span>
                <span id="pg91-p3-s7">But say nothing, for the moment, of how that was accomplished. </span>
                <span id="pg91-p3-s8">If he is in a serious mood dwell on the troubles liquor has caused you, being careful not to moralize or lecture. </span>

                <span id="pg92-p1-s5">If he sticks to the idea that he can still control his drinking, tell him that possibly he can - if he is not too alcoholic. </span>

                <span id="pg98-p1-s2">The minute we put our work on a service plane, the alcoholic commences to rely upon our assistance rather than upon God. </span>

                <span id="pg108-p1-s2">Perhaps your husband has been living in that strange world of alcoholism where everything is distorted and exaggerated. </span>

                <span id="pg108-p1-s4">Of course, there is such a thing as incompatibility, but in nearly every instance the alcoholic only seems to be unloving and inconsiderate; it is usually because he is warped and sickened that he says and does these appalling things. </span>

                <span id="pg125-p1-s2">This is a condition which, in ordinary life, would produce untold grief; there might be scandalous gossip, laughter at the expense of other people, and a tendency to take advantage of intimate information. </span>

            <p id="pg125-p2">
                <span id="pg125-p2-s0">Another principle we observe carefully is that we do not relate intimate experiences of another person unless we are sure he would approve. </span>

                <span id="pg125-p2-s2">A man may criticize or laugh at himself and it will affect others favorably, but criticism or ridicule coming from another often produces the contrary effect. </span>
                <span id="pg125-p2-s3">Members of a family should watch such matters carefully, for one careless, inconsiderate remark has been known to raise the very devil. </span>
                <span id="pg125-p2-s4">We alcoholics are sensitive people. </span>

                <span id="pg128-p1-s2">He becomes a religious enthusiast. </span>
                <span id="pg128-p1-s3">He is unable to focus on anything else. </span>

                <span id="pg128-p1-s5">There is talk about spiritual matters morning, noon and night. </span>
                <span id="pg128-p1-s6">He may demand that the family find God in a hurry, or exhibit amazing indifference to them and say he is above worldly considerations. </span>
                <span id="pg128-p1-s7">He may tell mother, who has been religious all her life, that she doesn't know what it's all about, and that she had better get his brand of spirituality while there is yet time. </span>

                <span id="pg128-p2-s4">They may not see why their love and devotion did not straighten him out. </span>
                <span id="pg128-p2-s5">Dad is not so spiritual after all, they say. </span>
                <span id="pg128-p2-s6">If he means to right his past wrongs, why all this concern for everyone in the world but his family? </span>

                <span id="pg129-p1-s2">If the family will appreciate that dad's current behavior is but a phase of his development, all will be well. </span>

                <span id="pg130-p1-s2">We have come to believe He would like us to keep our heads in the clouds with Him, but that our feet ought to be firmly planted on earth. </span>

                <span id="pg139-p2-s3">Drinking occasionally, and understanding your own reactions, it is possible for you to become quite sure of many things which, so far as the alcoholic is concerned, are not always so. </span>
                <span id="pg139-p2-s4">As a moderate drinker, you can take your liquor or leave it alone. </span>

            <p id="pg151-p2">
                <span id="pg151-p2-s0">For most normal folks, drinking means conviviality, companionship and colorful imagination. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s1">It means release from care, boredom and worry. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s2">It is joyous intimacy with friends and a feeling that life is good. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s3">But not so with us in those last days of heavy drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s4">The old pleasures were gone. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s5">They were but memories. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s6">Never could we recapture the great moments of the past. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s7">There was an insistent yearning to enjoy life as we once did and a heartbreaking obsession that some new miracle of control would enable us to do it. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p2-s8">There was always one more attempt - and one more failure. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg151-p3">
                <span id="pg151-p3-s0">The less people tolerated us, the more we withdrew from society, from life itself. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p3-s1">As we became subjects of King Alcohol, shivering denizens of his mad realm, the chilling vapor that is loneliness settled down. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p3-s2">It thickened, ever becoming blacker. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p3-s3">Some of us sought out sordid places, hoping to find understanding companionship and approval. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p3-s4">Momentarily we did - then would come oblivion and the awful awakening to face the hideous Four Horsemen - Terror, Bewilderment, Frustration, Despair. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p3-s5">Unhappy drinkers who read this page will understand! </span>

                <span id="pg151-p4-s0">Now and then a serious drinker, being dry at the moment says, "I don't miss it at all. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p4-s1">Feel better. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p4-s2">Work better. </span>
                <span id="pg151-p4-s3">Having a better time." </span>

                <span id="pg152-p2-s0">Yes, there is a substitute and it is vastly more than that. </span>

                <span id="pg152-p2-s2">There you will find release from care, boredom and worry. </span>
                <span id="pg152-p2-s3">Your imagination will be fired. </span>
                <span id="pg152-p2-s4">Life will mean something at last. </span>

                <span id="pg153-p1-s0">It may seem incredible that these men are to become happy, respected, and useful once more. </span>
                <span id="pg153-p1-s1">How can they rise out of such misery, bad repute and hopelessness? </span>
                <span id="pg153-p1-s2">The practical answer is that since these things have happened among us, they can happen with you. </span>
                <span id="pg153-p1-s3">Should you wish them above all else, and be willing to make use of our experience, we are sure they will come. </span>

                <span id="pg153-p1-s5">Our own recovery proves that! </span>

                <span id="pg153-p2-s0">Our hope is that when this chip of a book is launched on the world tide of alcoholism, defeated drinkers will seize upon it, to follow its suggestions. </span>
                <span id="pg153-p2-s1">Many, we are sure, will rise to their feet and march on. </span>
                <span id="pg153-p2-s2">They will approach still other sick ones and fellowships of Alcoholics Anonymous may spring up in each city and hamlet, havens for those who must find a way out. </span>

                <span id="pg154-p2-s1">At one end of the room stood a glass covered directory of local churches. </span>
                <span id="pg154-p2-s2">Down the lobby a door opened into an attractive bar. </span>
                <span id="pg154-p2-s3">He could see the gay crowd inside. </span>
                <span id="pg154-p2-s4">In there he would find companionship and release. </span>
                <span id="pg154-p2-s5">Unless he took some drinks, he might not have the courage to scrape an acquaintance and would have a lonely week-end. </span>

                <span id="pg154-p3-s0">Of course he couldn't drink, but why not sit hopefully at a table, a bottle of ginger ale before him? </span>
                <span id="pg154-p3-s1">After all, had he not been sober six months now? </span>
                <span id="pg154-p3-s2">Perhaps he could handle, say, three drinks - no more! </span>

                <span id="pg154-p3-s6">With a shiver, he turned away and walked down the lobby to the church directory. </span>
                <span id="pg154-p3-s7">Music and gay chatter still floated to him from the bar. </span>

                <span id="pg155-p1-s1">It was the usual situation: home in jeopardy, wife ill, children distracted, bills in arrears and standing damaged. </span>
                <span id="pg155-p1-s2">He had a desperate desire to stop, but saw no way out, for he had earnestly tried many avenues of escape. </span>

                <span id="pg155-p2-s1">A spiritual experience, he conceded, was absolutely necessary, but the price seemed high upon the basis suggested. </span>
                <span id="pg155-p2-s2">He told how he lived in constant worry about those who might find out about his alcoholism. </span>
                <span id="pg155-p2-s3">He had, of course, the familiar alcoholic obsession that few knew of his drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg155-p2-s4">Why, he argued, should he lose the remainder of his business, only to bring still more suffering to his family by foolishly admitting his plight to people from whom he made his livelihood? </span>
                <span id="pg155-p2-s5">He would do anything, he said, but that. </span>

                <span id="pg156-p2-s2">As we shall see, he now means a great deal to his community, and the major liabilities of thirty years of hard drinking have been repaired in four. </span>

                <span id="pg158-p2-s0">On the third day the lawyer gave his life to the care and direction of his Creator, and said he was perfectly willing to do anything necessary. </span>
                <span id="pg158-p2-s1">His wife came, scarcely daring to be hopeful, though she thought she saw something different about her husband already. </span>

                <span id="pg159-p0-s2">He consented, however, to go to the hospital, where he occupied the very room recently vacated by the lawyer. </span>

            <p id="pg159-p1">
                <span id="pg159-p1-s0">He had three visitors. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p1-s1">After a bit, he said, "The way you fellows put this spiritual stuff makes sense. </span>

                <span id="pg159-p2-s2">He now returned home, leaving behind his first acquaintance, the lawyer and the devil-may-care chap. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p2-s3">These men had found something brand new in life. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p2-s4">Though they knew they must help other alcoholics if they would remain sober, that motive became secondary. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p2-s5">It was transcended by the happiness they found in giving themselves for others. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p2-s6">They shared their homes, their slender resources, and gladly devoted their spare hours to fellow-sufferers. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p2-s7">They were willing, by day or night, to place a new man in the hospital and visit him afterward. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p2-s8">They grew in numbers. </span>
                <span id="pg159-p2-s9">They experienced a few distressing failures, but in those cases they made an effort to bring the man's family into a spiritual way of living, thus relieving much worry and suffering. </span>

                <span id="pg159-p3-s1">Seeing much of each other, scarce an evening passed that someone's home did not shelter a little gathering of men and women, happy in their release, and constantly thinking how they might present their discovery to some newcomer. </span>

                <span id="pg160-p1-s2">This couple has since become so fascinated that they have dedicated their home to the work. </span>
                <span id="pg160-p1-s3">Many a distracted wife has visited this house to find loving and understanding companionship among women who knew her problem, to hear from the lips of their husbands what had happened to them, to be advised how her own wayward mate might be hospitalized and approached when next he stumbled. </span>

            <p id="pg160-p2">
                <span id="pg160-p2-s0">Many a man, yet dazed from his hospital experience, has stepped over the threshold of that home into freedom. </span>
                <span id="pg160-p2-s1">Many an alcoholic who entered there came away with an answer. </span>
                <span id="pg160-p2-s2">He succumbed to that gay crowd inside, who laughed at their own misfortunes and understood his. </span>
                <span id="pg160-p2-s3">Impressed by those who visited him at the hospital, he capitulated entirely when, later, in an upper room of this house, he heard the story of some man whose experience closely tallied with his own. </span>
                <span id="pg160-p2-s4">The expression on the faces of the women, that indefinable something in the eyes of the men, the stimulating and electric atmosphere of the place, conspired to let him know that here was haven at last. </span>

                <span id="pg160-p3-s0">The very practical approach to his problems, the absence of intolerance of any kind, the informality, the genuine democracy, the uncanny understanding which these people had were irresistible. </span>

                <span id="pg161-p2-s0">But life among Alcoholics Anonymous is more than attending gatherings and visiting hospitals. </span>
                <span id="pg161-p2-s1">Cleaning up old scrapes, helping to settle family differences, explaining the disinherited son to his irate parents, lending money and securing jobs for each other, when justified - these are everyday occurrences. </span>
                <span id="pg161-p2-s2">No one is too discredited or has sunk too low to be welcomed cordially - if he means business. </span>

strenuous spree. </span>

tortured me, and if I did my nerves did the same
thing. </span>
                <span id="pg175-p0-s2">After three years of this, I wound up in the
local hospital where they attempted to help me, but
I would get my friends to smuggle me a quart, or I
would steal the alcohol about the building, so that I
got rapidly worse. </span>

some way, and I was in bed about two months before
I could venture out of the house. </span>
                <span id="pg175-p1-s1">I stayed about town
a couple of months more and then returned to resume
my practice. </span>
                <span id="pg175-p1-s2">I think I must have been thoroughly
scared by what had happened, or by the doctor, or
probably both, so that I did not touch a drink again
until the country went dry. </span>

            <p id="pg175-p2">
                <span id="pg175-p2-s0">With the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment I
felt quite safe. </span>
                <span id="pg175-p2-s1">I knew everyone would buy a few
bottles, or cases, of liquor as their exchequers per-
mitted, and that it would soon be gone. </span>
                <span id="pg175-p2-s2">Therefore it
would make no great difference, even if I should do
some drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg175-p2-s3">At that time I was not aware of the
almost unlimited supply the government made it pos-

knowledge of the bootlegger who soon appeared on
the horizon. </span>
                <span id="pg175-p2-s4">I drank with moderation at first, but it
took me only a relatively short time to drift back into

                <span id="pg176-p0-s0">a man of means, I knew that if I did not stay sober
enough to earn money, I would run out of liquor. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p0-s1">Most
of the time, therefore, I did not take the morn-
ing drink which I craved so badly, but instead would
fill up on large doses of sedatives to quiet the jitters,
which distressed me terribly. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p0-s2">Occasionally, I would
yield to the morning craving, but if I did, it would be
only a few hours before I would be quite unfit for
work. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p0-s3">This would lessen my chances of smuggling
some home that evening, which in turn would mean
a night of futile tossing around in bed followed by a
morning of unbearable jitters. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p0-s4">During the subsequent
fifteen years I had sense enough never to go to the
hospital if I had been drinking, and very seldom did
I receive patients. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p0-s5">I would sometimes hide out in one
of the clubs of which I was a member, and had the
habit at times of registering at a hotel under a fictitious
name. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p0-s6">But my friends usually found me and I would
go home if they promised that I should not be scolded. </span>

                <span id="pg176-p1-s0">If my wife was planning to go out in the afternoon,
I would get a large supply of liquor and smuggle it
home and hide it in the coal bin, the clothes chute,
over door jambs, over beams in the cellar, and in cracks
in the cellar tile. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p1-s1">I also made use of old trunks and
chests, the old can container, and even the ash con-
tainer. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p1-s2">The water tank on the toilet I never used,
because that looked too easy. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p1-s3">I found out later that
my wife inspected it frequently. </span>
                <span id="pg176-p1-s4">I used to put eight
or twelve ounce bottles of alcohol in a fur lined glove
and toss it onto the back airing porch when winter
days got dark enough. </span>

cized by our friends. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p2-s1">We could not be invited out
because I would surely get tight, and my wife dared
not invite people in for the same reason. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p2-s2">My phobia
for sleeplessness demanded that I get drunk every
night, but in order to get more liquor for the next
night, I had to stay sober during the day, at least up
to four o’clock. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p2-s3">This routine went on with few inter-
ruptions for seventeen years. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p2-s4">It was really a horrible
nightmare, this earning money, getting liquor, smug-
gling it home, getting drunk, morning jitters, taking
large doses of sedatives to make it possible for me to
earn more money, and so on ad nauseam. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p2-s5">I used to
promise my wife, my friends, and my children that
I would drink no more—promises which seldom kept
me sober even through the day, though I was very
sincere when I made them. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg177-p3">
                <span id="pg177-p3-s0">For the benefit of those experimentally inclined, I
should mention the so-called beer experiment. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p3-s1">When
beer first came back, I thought that I was safe. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p3-s2">I
could drink all I wanted of that. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p3-s3">It was harmless;
nobody ever got drunk on beer. </span>
                <span id="pg177-p3-s4">So I filled the cellar
full, with the permission of my good wife. </span>

spoke with great freedom from embarrassment, which

health was at the breaking point, and I was thoroughly
miserable. </span>
                <span id="pg178-p1-s4">I sensed they had something I did not
have, from which I might readily profit. </span>
                <span id="pg178-p1-s5">I learned that
it was something of a spiritual nature, which did not
appeal to me very much, but I thought it could do no
harm. </span>
                <span id="pg178-p1-s6">I gave the matter much time and study for the
next two and a half years, but I still got tight every
night nevertheless. </span>

shorter talks with this man afterward, and stopped
drinking abruptly. </span>
                <span id="pg179-p2-s2">This dry spell lasted for about three
weeks; then I went to Atlantic City to attend several
days’ meeting of a national society of which I was a
member. </span>

to get tight again. </span>

                <span id="pg180-p2-s0">The question which might naturally come into your
mind would be: “What did the man do or say that was
different from what others had done or said?” It must
be remembered that I had read a great deal and talked
to everyone who knew, or thought they knew anything
about the subject of alcoholism. </span>
                <span id="pg180-p2-s1">But this was a man
who had experienced many years of frightful drink-
ing, who had had most all the drunkard’s experiences
known to man, but who had been cured by the very
means I had been trying to employ, that is to say the
spiritual approach. </span>
                <span id="pg180-p2-s2">He gave me information about
the subject of alcoholism which was undoubtedly
helpful. <em>Of far more importance was the fact that he
was the first living human with whom I had ever
talked, who knew what he was talking about in regard to
alcoholism from actual experience. </span>
                <span id="pg180-p2-s3">In other words,
he talked my language.</em> He knew all the answers, and
certainly not because he had picked them up in his
reading. </span>

Later, she would say, “You don’t like me. </span>

you admit it?” And as her disease was reaching the

dumb cat-and-dog doctor he’s not a Beverly Hills psychiatrist. </span>

the phone, turned on the light, and carried on
a conversation with a patient. </span>
                <span id="pg409-p2-s2">I didn’t know whether I

the night. </span>

more through the day to increase the high, and more
to maintain it; when I overshot the mark, I’d take
tranquilizers to level off. </span>
                <span id="pg410-p1-s3">The pep pills affected my

                <span id="pg410-p2-s0">For the leveling-off process, I just loved intravenous
Demerol, but I found it hard to practice good medicine
while shooting morphine. </span>
                <span id="pg410-p2-s1">Following an injection, I

out of codeine and Percodan and the tranquilizers. </span>
                <span id="pg410-p2-s3">However, for a period of time I was injecting Pento -
thal intravenously to put myself to sleep. </span>

and it seemed delightful. </span>
                <span id="pg410-p2-s6">I didn’t feel I could lie in
bed and squirt the stuff in my veins while my kids and
wife stood around watching me, so I kept the drug in

I had to put myself back to sleep three times, and
then I finally decided to give it up. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s2">But to do so, I had
to get all the stuff out of the house and out of my possession. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s3">In the end I had to do the same with alcohol
and all pills. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s4">I wasn’t able to quit chemicals as long as
they were in the house. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s5">If they were around, I always
found a need for them—especially the pills. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s6">I never in
my life took a tranquilizer, sedative, or pep pill because
I was a pillhead. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s7">I always took it because I had
the symptom that only that pill would relieve. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s8">There -
fore, every pill was medically indicated at the time it
was taken. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s9">For me, pills don’t produce the desire to
swallow a pill; they produce the symptoms that require
that the pill be taken for relief. </span>
                <span id="pg411-p1-s10">As a physician and
pharmacist who had grown up in a drugstore-home,

                <span id="pg412-p0-s1">On each occasion I
had a convulsion on Sunday morning. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s2">Both times my
reaction was that I had had nothing to drink the night
before, so obviously alcohol had nothing to do with it. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s3">The neurologist in charge of my case didn’t think to
ask me whether I drank, and I didn’t think to tell him. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s4">As a result, he couldn’t figure out why I had the convulsions,
and he decided to send me to the Mayo
Clinic. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s5">It seemed to me I needed a consultation first. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s6">I happened to be the best diagnostician I knew at the
time, and certainly I knew my case better than anyone
else. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s7">So I sat down with me and went over the facts
behind the convulsions: personality changes, daily
headaches, sense of impending doom, sense of impend -
ing insanity. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s8">Suddenly, it was obvious to me: I had a
brain tumor and would die, and everyone would be
sorry for me. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p0-s9">The Mayo Clinic seemed like a good
place to have my diagnosis confirmed. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg412-p1">
                <span id="pg412-p1-s0">After nine days of tests at Mayo, I was put in the
locked ward—of all places! </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s1">That’s when that steel door
slammed shut, and Max was the one who went home. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s2">I didn’t like being on the nut ward, and I particularly
didn’t like being forced to ice cookies on Christmas
Eve. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s3">So I raised enough fuss that they finally agreed to
let me sign out, against medical advice. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s4">Max accepted
responsibility for me after I had promised never to
drink again, never to take another pill, never to swear
again, and never to talk to girls again. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s5">We got on the
plane and immediately had a big fight over whether
I’d drink the free booze. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s6">Max won; I didn’t drink it. </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s7">But by God, I wouldn’t talk or eat either! </span>
                <span id="pg412-p1-s8">And that

                <span id="pg413-p0-s0">When we got home, I got a bottle of Scotch and
went to bed. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p0-s1">The next day, Max called the neurologist
and told him about the Mayo psychiatrist’s opinion. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p0-s2">He arranged for me to see a local psychiatrist, who
quickly decided I should be in the mental-health unit
of our local hospital. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p0-s3">The people there insisted on putting
me in a ward, when Max and I both knew I ought
to have a private room. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p0-s4">Finally, she asked, “Do you
realize he’s on the staff of this hospital?” And I got my
private room. </span>

ward. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p1-s1">I never could quite get the knack of it and kept
asking myself, “What’s a nice guy like me doing in a
place like this?” They wanted me to make leather belts,
of all things! </span>
                <span id="pg413-p1-s2">Had I gone to school all those years just
to sit and make leather belts? </span>
                <span id="pg413-p1-s3">Besides, I couldn’t understand
the instructions. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p1-s4">The girl had explained them
to me four times, and I was too embarrassed to ask
her again. (I am pleased to state, however, that I had
gone to only a very few A.A. meetings before I was
able to make a really beautiful pair of moccasins—and
half of a wallet. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p1-s5">I wore those moccasins every night for
the next seven years, until they wore out. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p1-s6">For my seventh
A.A. birthday, my program-oriented, Al-Anon
wife had my moccasins bronzed. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p1-s7">Now I own perhaps
the most costly pair of moccasins anyone has ever
seen, and they help me remember where I’ve been.) </span>

            <p id="pg413-p2">
                <span id="pg413-p2-s0">In the hospital I hung on to the idea I’d had most of
my life: that if I could just control the external environment,
the internal environment would then become
comfortable. </span>
                <span id="pg413-p2-s1">Much of my time was spent writing letters,
notes, orders, and lists of things for Max, who was also
my office nurse, to do to keep the world running while </span>

our work over to the care of God. </span>
                <span id="pg414-p0-s3">Each with the other
as a witness, we took the Third Step out loud—just
as it says in the Big Book. </span>
                <span id="pg414-p0-s4">And life keeps getting simpler
and easier as we try to reverse my old idea, by
taking care of the internal environment via the Twelve

of itself.) </span>

            <p id="pg414-p1">
                <span id="pg414-p1-s0">One day as I sat there in the hospital, my psychiatrist
walked up behind me and asked, “How’d you like
to talk to the man from A.A.?” My reaction was that
I’d already helped all the patients on the ward, and I
still had plenty of problems of my own without trying
to help some drunk from A.A. </span>
                <span id="pg414-p1-s1">But, by the look on the
psychiatrist’s face, I could tell that it would really
make him happy if I agreed. </span>
                <span id="pg414-p1-s2">So, for no better reason
than to make him happy, I agreed. </span>
                <span id="pg414-p1-s3">Very shortly, I realized
that had been a mistake—when this big clown
came bounding into the room, almost shouting, “My
name is Frank, and I’m an alcoholic, ha-ha-ha!” I
really felt sorry for him; the only thing in life he had
to brag about was the fact that he was an alcoholic. </span>
                <span id="pg414-p1-s4">It
wasn’t until later that he told me he was an attorney. </span>

            <p id="pg414-p2">
                <span id="pg414-p2-s0">Against my better judgment, I went to a meeting
with him that night, and a strange thing began to happen. </span>
                <span id="pg414-p2-s1">The psychiatrist, who had generally been ignoring
me, now became quite interested; every day he
would ask me all kinds of questions about the A.A.
meetings. </span>

A.A. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p0-s1">But it quickly became obvious that he had this
childish notion instead: If he could get me to go to
enough meetings while in the hospital, I would continue
to go after he let me out. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p0-s2">So, for no better
reason than to fool him, I asked Frank to take me to a
meeting every night. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p0-s3">And Frank did set me up for a
meeting every night except Friday, when he thought
he might have a date with his girl friend. “That’s a
devil of a way to run an organization,” I thought, and
I reported Frank to the psychiatrist, who didn’t seem
perturbed; he just got someone else to take me on
Fridays. </span>

            <p id="pg415-p1">
                <span id="pg415-p1-s0">Eventually the psychiatrist discharged me from the
hospital, and Max and I began going to meetings ourselves. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p1-s1">Right from the start, I felt that they weren’t
doing anything for me, but they sure were helping
Max. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p1-s2">We sat in the back and talked only to each other. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p1-s3">It was precisely a year before I spoke at an A.A. meeting. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p1-s4">Although we enjoyed the laughter in the early
days, I heard a lot of things that I thought were stupid. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p1-s5">I interpreted “sober” as meaning “drinking but not
being drunk.” When a big, healthy-looking young fellow
stood up there and said, “I’m a success today if I
don’t drink today,” I thought, “Man, I’ve got a thousand
things to do today before I can brag about not
taking a drink, for God’s sake!” Of course, I was still
drinking at the time. (Today there is absolutely nothing
in the world more important to me than my keeping
this alcoholic sober; not taking a drink is by far the
most important thing I do each day.) </span>

            <p id="pg415-p2">
                <span id="pg415-p2-s0">It seemed that all they talked about at meetings was
drinking, drinking, drinking. </span>
                <span id="pg415-p2-s1">It made me thirsty. </span>

                <span id="pg416-p0-s0">wanted to talk about my many big problems; drinking
seemed a small one. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p0-s1">And I knew that giving up “one
drink for one day” wouldn’t really do any good. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p0-s2">Finally, after seven months, I decided to try it. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p0-s3">To this
day, I am amazed at how many of my problems—most
of which had nothing to do with drinking, I believed—
have become manageable or have simply disappeared
since I quit drinking. </span>

            <p id="pg416-p1">
                <span id="pg416-p1-s0">I had already given up all the narcotics, most of the
pills, and some of the alcohol when I first came to A.A. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p1-s1">By early July I had tapered off alcohol completely, and
I got off all pills in the ensuing few months. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p1-s2">When the
compulsion to drink left, it was relatively easy to stay
off alcohol. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p1-s3">But for some time, it was difficult to keep
from taking a pill when I had an appropriate symptom,
such as a cough, pain, anxiety, insomnia, a muscle
spasm, or an upset stomach. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p1-s4">It has gotten progressively
easier. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p1-s5">Today I feel I have used up my right to
chemical peace of mind. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg416-p2">
                <span id="pg416-p2-s0">It helped me a great deal to become convinced that
alcoholism was a disease, not a moral issue; that I had
been drinking as a result of a compulsion, even though
I had not been aware of the compulsion at the time;
and that sobriety was not a matter of willpower. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p2-s1">The
people of A.A. had something that looked much better
than what I had, but I was afraid to let go of what I
had in order to try something new; there was a certain
sense of security in the familiar. </span>
            </p>
            <p id="pg416-p3">
                <span id="pg416-p3-s0">At last, acceptance proved to be the key to my drinking
problem. </span>
                <span id="pg416-p3-s1">After I had been around A.A. for seven
months, tapering off alcohol and pills, not finding the

exactly the way it is supposed to be at this moment. </span>

to see the flaw in every person, every situation. </span>

years. </span>

scrawny adolescent, I was able to see things in her
that others couldn’t necessarily see—things like
beauty, charm, gaiety, a gift for being easy to talk to, a
sense of humor, and many other fine qualities. </span>
                <span id="pg418-p1-s4">It was
as if I had, rather than a Midas touch which turned
everything to gold, a magnifying mind that magnified
whatever it focused on. </span>

about Max, her good qualities grew and grew, and we
married, and all these qualities became more and
more apparent to me, and we were happier and happier. </span>

                <span id="pg418-p2-s0">But then as I drank more and more, the alcohol
seemed to affect my vision: Instead of continuing to
see what was good about my wife, I began to see her
defects. </span>
                <span id="pg418-p2-s1">And the more I focused my mind on her defects,
the more they grew and multiplied. </span>

change” in the Serenity Prayer meant not that I
should change my marriage, but rather that I should
change myself and learn to accept my spouse as she
was. </span>

drunkalogs, cigarette smoke—the worse the meeting
becomes. </span>
                <span id="pg419-p2-s2">But when I try to see what I can add to the
meeting, rather than what I can get out of it, and when
I focus my mind on what’s good about it, rather than
what’s wrong with it, the meeting keeps getting better
and better. </span>

a good day, and when I focus on what’s bad, I have a
bad day. </span>

rather than what we think. </span>
                <span id="pg419-p3-s1">We used to argue about
our differing ideas, but we can’t argue about our feelings. </span>
                <span id="pg419-p3-s2">I can tell her she ought not to think a certain way,
but I certainly can’t take away her right to feel however
she does feel. </span>

with Max in mind, from the First, saying, “I am powerless
over alcohol, and my homelife is unmanageable
by me,” to the Twelfth, in which I tried to think of her
as a sick Al-Anon and treat her with the love I would
give a sick A.A. newcomer. </span>

                <span id="pg420-p1-s0">Perhaps the best thing of all for me is to remember
that my serenity is inversely proportional to my expectations. </span>
                <span id="pg420-p1-s1">The higher my expectations of Max and other
people are, the lower is my serenity. </span>
                <span id="pg420-p1-s2">I can watch my
serenity level rise when I discard my expectations. </span>
                <span id="pg420-p1-s3">But then my “rights” try to move in, and they too can
force my serenity level down. </span>
                <span id="pg420-p1-s4">I have to discard my
“rights,” as well as my expectations, by asking myself,
How important is it, really? </span>

to my serenity, my emotional sobriety? </span>

when I place more value on my serenity and sobriety
than on anything else, I can maintain them at a higher

                <span id="pg420-p2-s0">Acceptance is the key to my relationship with God
today. </span>

for Him to tell me what to do. </span>

is in front of me to be done, and I leave the results up

and off my expectations, for my serenity is
directly proportional to my level of acceptance. </span>
